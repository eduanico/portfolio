## Passive Liveness Validation API

Built using Java with Spring Boot as Framework.
I managed to validate a person liveness integrating our country civil registry to allocate the reference image used by our validation engine in AWS Rekognition.
Using metrics to prevent **spoofing attacks** and **identity duplicity attacks**.  
This API helped our customers to validate persons liveness in an easy way using API-REST libraries and security methods as JWT Tokens. Some production examples of use are in the **electronic signature** area and **onboarding flows**.
